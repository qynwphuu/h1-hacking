<h2>b) Interested Parties</h2>

<p>
In simple terms, ISO 27001 has these areas:
Context is what you protect and why.
Leadership is who is responsible.
Planning is how you think ahead.
Operation is what you actually do.
Performance evaluation is how you check things if they still work.
Improvement is how you fix problems.
